# Usage

You work with this app as an author via the Django Admin.

You can [customize](customize-admin.md) the editor for the admin at the site
level or just use the stock text areas.

The `description` field in the admin represents the text that will be used in
different HTML META header tags that are useful for controlling the display
on social networks like Twitter and Facebook.

This is the same idea behind the `primary_image` field in the admin.
